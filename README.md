# Little Big Go

The Little Big Go compiler adventure is an exploration into writing a Go to LLVM IR compiler.

**Note:** The `lbg` project is not go-getable at this stage, as the LLVM IR dependency is an experimental version of https://github.com/llir/llvm (which is yet to be merged back into the master branch).
