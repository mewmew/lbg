# Little Big Go

The Little Big Go compiler adventure is an exploration into writing a Go to LLVM IR compiler.

**Note:** The project is not go-getable at this stage, mainly as the LLVM IR dependency is not yet stabalized. The current version of lbg uses an experimental version of https://github.com/llir/llvm.
